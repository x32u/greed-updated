```
to add custom permission you need to add it to the brief of the command


   @antinuke.command(
        name="settings",
        aliases=["config"],
        brief="antinuke owner & admin",
        example="ban on"
    )

like this
```

until you add all the keys on the condfig nothing will work

```
Please Dont Make This The Next Pretend
